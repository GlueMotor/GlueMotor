# GlueMotor
GlueMotor is a simple idea that allows you to control hobby servo motors from audio jack (headphone jack) with very simple straight connection. <a href="http://makezine.com/projects/make-34/smartphone-servo/">Here is a good article about GlueMotor in Make: magazine</a> (actually, I wrote that) available for more detailed information.

*Important notice: GlueMotor may not work with some servo motors that have higher control signal threshold level. Also some Android devices that have not enough audio output level may not work.*

## Supported platforms
Currently this project supports 3 different platforms:
- Android
- iOS
  - Objective-C
  - Swift (will be published later, maybe, probably, any demands??)
- JavaScript
  - JavaScript stand alone code
  - MOONBlockâ„¢ hack.js code (<a href="http://www.moonblock.jp/docs/">"MOONBlock"</a> is a trademark of Ubiquitous Entertainment Inc.)

## How to build the sample projects
- Android: open the Android/ folder with Android Studio
- iOS: open the project file under the iOS/Objective-C/ folder with Xcode

Each project includes "GlueMotorCore" class that is the core module of GlueMotor. For your own project, just copy the "GlueMotorCore" class file(s) into your project.

## Requirements
In terms of using the GlueMotor application, you need to create your own cable. Please refer to <a href="http://www.gluemotor.com/">GlueMotor Web Site</a> or <a href="http://makezine.com/projects/make-34/smartphone-servo/">Make: magazine article</a> for more details.
